<i>"Hello, friend?"
That's lame.</i>

00:-06:-27.-080 --> 00:-06:-24.-839
<i>Maybe I should give you a name.</i>

00:-06:-24.-760 --> 00:-06:-22.-234
<i>But that's a slippery slope.
You're only in my head.</i>

00:-06:-22.-160 --> 00:-06:-20.-317

00:-06:-19.-800 --> 00:-06:-18.-594

00:-06:-18.-480 --> 00:-06:-15.-476
<i>It's actually happened. I'm
talking to an imaginary person.</i>

00:-06:-13.-840 --> 00:-06:-11.-189
<i>What I'm about to tell you
is top secret.</i>

00:-06:-11.-120 --> 00:-06:-08.-799
<i>A conspiracy bigger
than all of us.</i>

00:-06:-07.-720 --> 00:-06:-03.-635
<i>There's a powerful group of people out
there that are secretly running the world.</i>

00:-06:-02.-120 --> 00:-06:00.-152

no one knows about.</i>

<i>The top one percent

00:-05:-54.-920 --> 00:-05:-52.-553
<i>The guys that play God
without permission.</i>

00:-05:-49.-800 --> 00:-05:-47.-832
<i>And now I think
they're following me.</i>

00:-05:-38.-800 --> 00:-05:-36.-957
<i>This is about last night.</i>

00:-05:-36.-880 --> 00:-05:-34.-639
<i>I should've gone to
Angela's birthday party.</i>

00:-05:-33.-920 --> 00:-05:-32.-156

You're Ron?

00:-04:-34.-640 --> 00:-04:-33.-309
But...

00:-04:-33.-240 --> 00:-04:-31.-397
Your real name
is Rohit D'Temeta.

00:-04:-31.-320 --> 00:-04:-29.-318
You changed it to Ron
when you bought your first

00:-04:-29.-240 --> 00:-04:-26.-475

00:-04:-26.-400 --> 00:-04:-22.-873
Now, you got 17 of 'em with
eight more coming next quarter.

00:-04:-19.-400 --> 00:-04:-17.-671
May I help you with something?

00:-04:-17.-600 --> 00:-04:-14.-437
I like coming here,
'cause your Wi-Fi was fast.

00:-04:-14.-360 --> 00:-04:-10.-639
I mean, you're one of the few spots that
has a fiber connection with gigabit speed.

00:-04:-10.-520 --> 00:-04:-09.-314
It's good.

00:-04:-08.-560 --> 00:-04:-05.-590
I mean, it was so good, it
scratched that part of my mind.

00:-04:-05.-520 --> 00:-04:-03.-995
The part that...

00:-04:-03.-920 --> 00:-04:-01.-269
...doesn't allow good to
exist without condition.

00:-04:-01.-200 --> 00:-03:-57.-639
So, I started intercepting all
the traffic on your network.

00:-03:-57.-240 --> 00:-03:-55.-238
That's when I noticed
something strange.

00:-03:-53.-920 --> 00:-03:-52.-111
That's when I decided
to hack you.

00:-03:-50.-280 --> 00:-03:-47.-436
- Hack... - I know you run a
website called Plato's Boys.

00:-03:-47.-360 --> 00:-03:-46.-313
Pardon me?

00:-03:-46.-240 --> 00:-03:-43.-509
You're using Tor networking
to keep the servers anonymous.

00:-03:-43.-440 --> 00:-03:-41.-039
You made it really hard
for anyone to see it.

00:-03:-40.-960 --> 00:-03:-39.-959
But I saw it.

00:-03:-39.-040 --> 00:-03:-35.-274
The onion routing protocol, it's not
as anonymous as you think it is.

00:-03:-35.-200 --> 00:-03:-31.-434
Whoever's in control of the exit nodes
is also in control of the traffic,

00:-03:-31.-360 --> 00:-03:-30.-074
which makes me...

00:-03:-28.-960 --> 00:-03:-27.-470
...the one in control.

00:-03:-25.-080 --> 00:-03:-21.-997

- I own everything.

Personally, man,

00:-03:-01.-760 --> 00:-02:-57.-550
I was hoping it was just
gonna be some BDSM stuff.

00:-02:-57.-480 --> 00:-02:-54.-829
You realize how much simpler
that would've been?

00:-02:-49.-840 --> 00:-02:-47.-872
(TREMBLING)
I did not hurt anyone.

00:-02:-46.-840 --> 00:-02:-45.-315
I never did.

00:-02:-32.-600 --> 00:-02:-29.-391
I understand what it's like

00:-02:-29.-320 --> 00:-02:-27.-909
to be different.

00:-02:-25.-800 --> 00:-02:-23.-274
I'm very different, too.

00:-02:-20.-800 --> 00:-02:-17.-956
I mean, I don’t jerk off
to little kids, but...

00:-02:-16.-400 --> 00:-02:-14.-318
I don't know how
to talk to people.

00:-02:-13.-600 --> 00:-02:-10.-596
My dad was the only
one I could talk to.

00:-02:-07.-720 --> 00:-02:-06.-719
But he died.

00:-02:00.-880 --> 00:-01:-59.-515
I'm sorry to hear that.

Leukemia.

00:-01:-51.-920 --> 00:-01:-49.-633
Yeah, he definitely got it from

radiation at the company he worked
at, though I couldn't prove it.

00:-01:-45.-080 --> 00:-01:-43.-749
Now, he's dead.

00:-01:-42.-240 --> 00:-01:-40.-556

You don't have to worry anymore.

00:-01:-25.-320 --> 00:-01:-24.-080

No.

you'll want more and more.

the police anyway.

I won't pay you, sir.

00:00:-53.-520 --> 00:00:-51.-677
Remember,
you also broke the law.

00:00:-49.-520 --> 00:00:-47.-756
Actually, you're right.

00:00:-46.-800 --> 00:00:-45.-753
Partly.

00:00:-44.-400 --> 00:00:-41.-715
See, I usually do this kind
of thing from my computer,

00:00:-41.-640 --> 00:00:-38.-557
but this time I wanted
to do it AFK.

00:00:-38.-480 --> 00:00:-37.-433

on my social anxiety.

But there's always the threat of
you fleeing after I call you out.

00:00:-30.-800 --> 00:00:-26.-078
You know, you tell your sysadmin to take
your servers down, wipe all the data.

00:00:-26.000 --> 00:00:-24.-555
So...

00:00:-24.-480 --> 00:00:-19.-394
I made sure to include the current
time and location on my anonymous tip.

00:00:-19.-320 --> 00:00:-16.-589
Wait, hold on. I'll give you the money.
I'll pay you.

How much do you want? I'll pay you.

I mean, their... Their networks
are getting attacked every week.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.209
Who knows if they'll
still even be a client.

- They're coming in?
- Yeah.

about the dress code?

they have any questions.

start smoking again?

Did you not get my
texts last night?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.728
I sent you exactly 13 of them.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.609

<i>But I'll hack him soon enough.
I always do.</i>

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.489
I know you're not yelling
like before, which is good,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.688
but I can tell you're
still holding on to it.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.127
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.645
You're angry at everyone.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.246
At society...
ELLIOT: <i>F... society.</i>

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.209
I know you have
a lot to be angry about,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.123
but keeping it to yourself
and staying quiet,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.282
like you're doing,
it's not going to help you.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.451
There's pain underneath.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.403
That's where our
work needs to go.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.443
What is it about society
that disappoints you so much?

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.285
Oh, I don't know.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.324
Is it that we collectively thought
Steve Jobs was a great man,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.722
<i>even when we knew he made billions
off the backs of children?</i>

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.002
Or maybe it's that it feels like
all our heroes are counterfeit.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.401
<i>The world itself's
just one big hoax.</i>

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.641

of bullshit masquerading as insight.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.243
<i>Our social media
faking as intimacy.</i>

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.008
Or is it that we voted for this?

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.247
Not with our rigged elections,
but with our things.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.930
<i>Our property.
Our money.</i>

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.011
I'm not saying anything new.
We all know why we do this.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.526
Not because Hunger Games
books makes us happy.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.689
<i>But because we wanna be sedated.</i>

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.806

Because we're cowards.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.771
You understand the pain.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.730
You wanna protect
people from it.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.964
You wanna protect me from it.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.409
I respect that about you.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.127

Let's talk about last night.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.323

Angela's birthday party?

ELLIOT:
Yeah. <i>It was nice.</i>

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.605
KRISTA: <i>Did you try to talk to anyone?</i>
ELLIOT: <i>Sure.</i>

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.724
I got a girl's number.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.921
- You did?
ELLIOT: (LAUGHS) She's cute.

<i>She likes The Hunger Games.</i>

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.884
You're hiding again, Elliot.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.811
When you hide,
your delusions come back.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.044
It's a slippery slope.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.365
Let's talk about the men in
black you've been seeing.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.851
Are they still there?

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.845
No, they're...

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.251
I told you, they're gone.

gave me are working.

- Plans, right.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.051
That's what you said the last
three times I asked you, uh...

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.684
Look, bud, you and Angela have
been close for a long time.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.651
And that's even more reason why
I want us to be on good terms.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.608
(STAMMERS) I just... I feel like
things have been awkward between us.

You're gonna frame him?
No one's gonna believe that.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.689
I met him.
He's a moron.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.526
So are the FBI.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.483
Even if they don't
believe he did it,

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.046
they'll believe he gave
someone access to it.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.521
And he'll just go to jail.
What good'll that do?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.368
You don't take down a conglomerate
by shooting them in the heart.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.965
That's the thing
about conglomerates,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.405
they don't have hearts.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.889
You take 'em down limb by limb.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.205
And as they unravel,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.487
their illusion
of control unravels.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.925
You have to change
this .dat file, okay?

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.923
But put Colby's IP in there.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.161

You're the one
who stopped the hack.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.009
You know, uh, the gals in analysis
said this was a tough one.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.243

our account executive, Angela.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.405
Okay, we first noticed the breach at 2:07 a.m.

Yeah. Okay, Angela.
That's what we're here for.

Yes.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.569
Anyway, he arrived at
the office at 2:35, and I...

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.849
Okay, wait, wait, wait. So that's, uh,
almost a half hour after the initial breach.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.490
Why didn't anyone pipe
in from their laptops?

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.881
It's not... It wouldn't
have been secure.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.329
If someone
terminaled in on this.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.121
It was...

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.487
...the smarter move to have someone come
in so they can log in on a secure line.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.766
Exactly.
Then, Lloyd was able to...

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.764

Not on this level. We need to stick
to the more tech savvy here.

Now, let's get to
the heart of this thing,

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.841
What?

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.967
You won't talk to me.

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.565
You haven't talked
to me since the meeting.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.723
I don't wanna talk to you,
because I feel embarrassed.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.402
Every time I think
about what happened.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.926
Okay?

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.851
It's fine.
I'll get over it.

It's been three weeks.
I have to get back to work.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.249
You're just gonna ignore me? You didn't
have to stick up for me in there.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.128
I know that you were just
trying to help, but just...

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.281
Don't do it again!

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.766
Even if I'm losing, let me lose.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.327
Okay?

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.564
Don't look confused!

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.083
Just say...

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.281
"Okay."

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.481
